  ## About Me

 Hi! I'm Mariana Carvajal, a 7th-semester Systems Engineering student with a strong foundation in technology, organization, and problem-solving. I combine technical training with real-world administrative and customer facing experience, which allows me to understand both systems and people.
 
 I’m especially drawn to databases and Front-End development. I enjoy working with data structure and organization on one side, and creating clean, user friendly interfaces on the other.
